Absolutely! Here's a **simplified and beginner-friendly `README.md`** for your **`dex-tor`** project. It still explains the key points, but in clearer language, without technical jargon overload:

# 💧 DexTor – A Modern Uniswap V2 Clone with Chainlink and OpenZeppelin

**DexTor** is a smart contract project that lets you create a decentralized exchange (DEX) just like **Uniswap V2**, but written from scratch using the **latest version of Solidity**.

It’s clean, simple, secure — and ready to grow.

---

## 🌟 What Is This?

- A simplified version of Uniswap V2 (the most famous DEX on Ethereum).
- Built using modern Solidity (`^0.8.x`) — no old-school code.
- Includes **OpenZeppelin** for safer contracts.
- Uses **Chainlink oracles** to get real-world token prices (like ETH/USD).

---

## 🧠 Who Is It For?

- Developers learning how DEXs like Uniswap work.
- Teams building their own token swap system.
- Projects needing a reliable base to create a custom AMM.
- Anyone who wants to learn about how DeFi works, step-by-step.

---

## 🔧 Main Features

✅ Fully rewritten AMM (Uniswap V2-style)  
✅ Uses latest Solidity version (`0.8.x`)  
✅ Safer code with [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts)  
✅ Live market prices from [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)  
✅ Easy to extend or customize

---

## 🧱 How It Works

1. Factory creates Pairs
2. Pair holds liquidity (tokenA + tokenB)
3. LP tokens are given to liquidity providers
4. Swaps use the formula: tokenA \* tokenB = constant (k)
5. Chainlink oracles provide real-time token prices
```

---

### 🔁 Example: Swapping Tokens

1. You add liquidity: ETH + DAI
2. Someone wants to swap DAI for ETH
3. The contract uses math to adjust balances and charge a small fee
4. Chainlink oracle checks the real market price (optional)

## 🧩 Key Contracts

| Contract            | What It Does                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `DexTorFactory`     | Deploys and tracks all trading pairs   |
| `DexTorPair`        | Handles swaps and holds token balances |
| `DexTorERC20`       | Issues LP tokens for liquidity         |
| `DexTorPriceOracle` | Gets prices from Chainlink oracles     |

---

## 🛡️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity `^0.8.20`** – latest features and safety
- **OpenZeppelin** – trusted building blocks (ERC20, security)
- **Chainlink** – real-world price data (ETH/USD, BTC/USD...)

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

- [ ] Add Router for easy swapping
- [ ] LP token `permit()` support (gasless approvals)
- [ ] Governance and fee options
- [ ] Frontend demo (React + Wagmi + Ethers.js)

---

## ⚙️ Example Use Case

> **Build your own token exchange**, powered by real-world prices.

Let’s say you launch a token called `$COFFEE`.  
You pair it with ETH on DexTor.  
Now, users can trade $COFFEE/ETH directly — and you can see if your on-chain price is close to the market using Chainlink.
